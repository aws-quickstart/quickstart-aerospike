{partner-product-short-name} is a real-time NoSQL data-storage platform. It delivers predictable performance at petabyte scale with microsecond latency across billions of transactions. 

When you use Aerospike with data-intensive, geodistributed applications, it performs like a cache with the persistence of a NoSQL data platform. It provides multisite clustering, cross-datacenter replication, fast restarts, rapid rebalancing, and security-related features. 

Aerospike features a hybrid memory architecture where indexes, including the primary index and optional secondary indexes, are stored by default in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) for fast access. You can also store data on solid state drives (SSDs) by configuring each namespace separately. Small namespaces can take advantage of DRAM, and larger ones gain the cost benefits of SSDs.  

Quick Starts are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates. You use Quick Starts to launch, configure, and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS. This Quick Start helps you build an {partner-product-short-name} cluster.
