.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or more Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances configured with {partner-product-name} and Aerospike tools.
** An Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume in each subnet.
* Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring the Aerospike instances.
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) for Aerospike migration.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
