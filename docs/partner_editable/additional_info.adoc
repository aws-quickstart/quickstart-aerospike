// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Don’t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading
After the AWS CloudFormation stack is complete, test the deployment by checking whether the instances were properly enrolled with your {partner-product-short-name} project.

To validate the system and verify the system configuration, follow these steps:

. From the bastion host, use SSH to log in to one of the Aerospike instances created by Quick Start template. Use SSH key forwarding for security purposes. For more info on SSH key forwarding, see https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/using-ssh-agent-forwarding[Using SSH agent forwarding^].

$ ssh ec2-user@<aerospike-instance>

. Verify cluster information using `asadm` command. More information, see https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/tools/asadm/[Aerospike Admin (asadm)^]. A two-node cluster output looks like this:

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

Follow these best practices: https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/deploy_guides/aws/recommendations/index.html[Aerospike on Amazon EC2 - Recommendations^].

Also set up a backup plan your {partner-product-short-name} data. For details, see https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/deploy_guides/aws/backup/index.html[Backup and Recovery in AWS^].

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

When you run {partner-product-short-name} in production, review and ensure that your security best practices are understood and followed. You'll find some recommended security best practices in https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/deploy_guides/aws/recommendations/index.html[Aerospike on Amazon EC2 - Recommendations^].

== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.
